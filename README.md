# woofles

A full stack web application for dog lovers looking to adopt their next furry friend!

### üí° Why I Built This

This solo project was built with React, Node.js, PostgreSQL, and Bootstrap to get a good foundation on full stack web development.

Inspired by modern dating apps, I wanted to showcase adoptable dogs (because dogs are 1000% better than humans in my humble opinion) and I wanted to learn about swipe gestures and animations. As I was working on this project, Tinder announced that they implemented this idea of [showcasing adoptable dogs in celebration of National Dog Week 2022](https://techcrunch.com/2022/09/20/tinder-finds-a-better-use-by-adding-adoptable-dogs-to-its-app-in-celebration-of-national-dog-week/amp/)!
